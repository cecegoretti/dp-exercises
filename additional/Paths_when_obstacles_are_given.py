#compute number of paths from top left corner to bottom right (by moving only down and right) when a grid of obstacles is given
#leetcode exercise: https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=dynamic-programming
#alternative approach: in this case obstacle are taken into account when doing the next move. It can also be optimized by taking into 
account obstacle if they are in the cell you are computing, and setting the value of paths to 0 if there is an obstacle. Once this 
test is done, then the update function would work as in the normal way of computing paths without obstacles.
#computational cost: memory O(m*n), complexity: O(m*n)

class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m=len(obstacleGrid)
        n=len(obstacleGrid[0])
        if obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1]==1 or obstacleGrid[0][0]==1:
            return 0
        paths=[[0]*n for j in range(m)]
        paths[m-1][n-1]=1
        for k in range(1,m):
            if obstacleGrid[m-1-k][n-1]==1:
                paths[m-1-k][n-1]=0
            else:
                paths[m-1-k][n-1]=paths[m-1-k+1][n-1]
        for j in range(1,n):
            if obstacleGrid[m-1][n-1-j]==1:
                paths[m-1][n-1-j]=0
            else:
                paths[m-1][n-1-j]=paths[m-1][n-1-j+1]
        for j in range(1,n):
            for k in range(1,m):
                    paths[m-1-k][n-1-j]=(1-obstacleGrid[m-k][n-1-j])*paths[m-k][n-1-j]+(1-obstacleGrid[m-1-k][n-j])*paths[m-1-k][n-j]
        return paths[0][0]
